Proof that maximin can at most be minimax.

You're given a following 3x3 payoff matrix.

  1 2 3
1 a b c
2 d e f
3 g h i

If one tried to find the row player's maximin,
it would be same as figuring out the biggest, from the smallest of each of the rows, 
which I would like to call as SoR, stands for 'the Smallest of the Row' from now on in this article.

If one tried to find the row player's minimax,
it would be same as figuring out the smallest, from the biggest of each of the columns,
which I would like to call as BoC, stands for 'the Biggest of the Column' from now on in this article.

Say an entry 'a' is considered to be the SoR1, and BoC1 at the same time.
We can surely tell that 'b' and 'c' are bigger than or equal to 'a', since 'a' should be SoR1.
Likewise, 'd' and 'g' are smaller than or equal to 'a', since 'a' should be BoC1.

  1      2      3 
1 a      b(>=a) c(>=a)
2 d(<=a) e      f
3 g(<=a) h      i

SoR1 is 'a'.
SoR2 is at most d, which is smaller than or equal to 'a'.
SoR3 is at most g, which is smaller than or equal to 'a'.
Maximin is at most 'a'.

BoC1 is 'a'.
BoC2 is at least b, which is bigger than or equal to 'a'.
BoC3 is at least c, which is bigger than or equal to 'a'.
Minimax is at least 'a'.
